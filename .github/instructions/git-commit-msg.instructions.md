## Git Commit Msg Instructions

1. **Use the imperative mood**: Write your commit messages as if you are giving commands. For example, use "Fix bug" instead of "Fixed bug" or "Fixes bug".
2. **Be concise but descriptive**: Aim for a short summary (50 characters or less) that describes the change. If you need to provide more context, include a longer description in the body of the commit message.
3. **Use bullet points for multiple changes**: If your commit includes multiple changes, use bullet points in the body to list them clearly.
4. **Lower case subject line**: Always use all lower case for the subject line.
5. **Use conventional commits**: Use conventional commits by referring to the conventional commits specification at the [Conventional Commits](./conventional-commits-v1.0.0.instructions.md) instructions file.
   - Examples:
     - `feat: add new feature`
     - `fix: resolve issue with component rendering`
     - `docs: update readme with installation instructions`
     - `style: format code with prettier`
     - `refactor: improve performance of data fetching`
     - `test: add unit tests for new feature`
6. **Use the body for detailed explanations**: If your commit requires more explanation, use the body to provide context, rationale, and any relevant information.
7. **Proofread your commit message**: Before finalizing your commit, take a moment to read your message and ensure it accurately reflects the changes made.
